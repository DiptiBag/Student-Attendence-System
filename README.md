This is a student management system made using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. The system focuses on managing student attendance in a simple and interactive way. Users can select a date, add student names, and mark each student as Present or Absent. A unique roll number is automatically assigned to every student, and attendance status is displayed clearly in a tabular format. The interface is user-friendly, with color-coded status indicators that make attendance tracking easy to understand at a glance.
